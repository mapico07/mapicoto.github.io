            <p>Andrew John Hozier-Byrne, known professionally as Hozier, is an Irish musician, singer, and songwriter born on March 17, 1990, in Newcastle, Ireland1. His music primarily draws from folk, soul, and blues genres, often incorporating religious and literary themes, as well as taking political or social justice stances.
                Hozier’s debut single, “Take Me to Church,” released in 2013, became a rock radio hit in the U.S., peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified multi-platinum in several countries. His self-titled debut studio album, released in 2014, has been certified 6× platinum in Ireland and multi-platinum in other countries.
                In 2018, he released the EP “Nina Cried Power,” which featured the title track as a single and reached number one on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart. His second album, “Wasteland, Baby!” debuted atop the Irish Albums Chart and the Billboard 200 in 2019, and was certified gold in the U.S.
                In late 2022, Hozier collaborated with Bear McCreary for the song “Blood Upon the Snow,” intended for the video game God of War: Ragnarök. His third studio album, “Unreal Unearth,” was released in 2023 and debuted at number one on the Irish and UK charts. In 2024, he released the EP “Unheard,” which includes his first number-one single in Ireland, the US, and the UK, "Too Sweet".
                Hozier was born to a local banker and a jazz and blues drummer father, and a stay-at-home artist mother. He began writing songs at the age of 15, taught himself guitar, and sang in his school choir. He attended Delgany National School and later studied music education at Trinity College Dublin, although he missed exams to record demos for a music label and was refused a year’s deferral by the college.</p>
